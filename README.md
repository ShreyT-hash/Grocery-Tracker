# A Grocery Tracker

## Allows users to manage grocery purchases and give recipe suggestions based off what they buy.


Once the user the groceries have been put into the application, it will be able to provide the following information to the user
- Potential recipes that can be made 
- Notify user of any expiration dates
- Nutritional value of the food
- Financial summary (budgeting)

This application is targeted for those people who want 
to be more efficient when it comes to purchasing groceries.
For people who want to save some money and not waste food. 
Ideally, this application will be used by **university students**,
and **parents**.

As a university student myself, a lot of times its hard to keep track of
what is in my fridge and what to cook every day. A lot of times I end up
not having the right ingredients or end up throwing stuff out. By creating
a tracker, hopefully I can prevent this from happening.
